/*
    Adding Image Protocol:
        - to add an image, add it to the public/images/ with the format IMG_i.JPG format
        - add the image metadata to the END of the variable `imageMeta` below
        - to test how site would work, change all '/image/IMG_...' tags by appending public/ for testing purposes 
            (vercel needs us to omit the public/ for hosting though)
    Done! The image should be visible on the page and able to be clicked
